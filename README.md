# Personal_Portfolio
A template for a personal portfolio site.

An optional template gulpfile is included to make it easier to change the site and make it ready for distribution.

You have to install nodeJS first. Get it here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
After installation navigate to your project folder, where you downloaded this repository in this case, and using a terminal
type "npm install".

After that you are ready to go. Type gulp in the terminal to get a development environment going with an active watcher that refreshes the page when sccs or js files are altered.
To create a production site type gulp build. A dist folder will be created containing a project structure more appropriate for release.
